## *Cloud Sniper Analytics stack*

***Cloud Sniper*** introduces an analytics module to analyze data, metrics and telemetry generated on the cloud. This first version analyzes VPC flows to detect beaconing (call home) patterns.

AWS VPC Flow Logs stored on S3 are analyzed by the beaconing module, looking for beaconing patterns in those flows.
