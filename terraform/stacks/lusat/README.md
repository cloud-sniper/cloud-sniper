## *Cloud Lusat stack*

***Cloud Lusat*** is an open source tool written in python aimed to automate the internal threat intelligence generation, inventory collection and compliance checker for different AWS resources. ***Cloud Lusat*** collects information and saves it into an ElasticSearch index. For this stack we change the function for elasticsearch and we save the findings into the S3 bucket of ***Cloud Sniper*** to consolidate the findings and build automation at the top.
